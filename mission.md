The mission of Bacalhau is **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">to transform the use of data by giving developers familiar, first-class and decentralized tools that improve performance, simplify management, and unlock a new collaborative ecosystem</span>**.

Here is a short overview of each of these terms:

## Familiar

* As few changes as possible to their existing workflows (support their languages, their tools, their flows)
* Minimize boiler plate code and rewriting of working programs
* Sane extension points and gradual flexibility (don't force someone to rewrite everything just to add one flag)

## First-class

* Should feel native to their language
* Understands big data and how to manage workflows across it (processing a 100 MB csv should feel similar to a 100 TB parquet file)
* ...

## Decentralized

* The network is not dependent on any one party, e.g., not dependent on a company, foundation, or other organization to continue operating.
* No centralized parties can control, stop, or censor the network, its operation, or its participants.
* Users and providers are not controlled or governed by powerful intermediaries.

## Improve Performance

* Give access to data developers to hosted, high performance compute
* Minimize ingress/egress will reduce costs and accelerate development
* Reduce dependencies through isolation by running in isolated environments

## Simplify Management

* Automatic orchestration of jobs with no centralized administration
* Declarative language for identifying workers by region, data, compute profile
* Auto-provisioning/market forces for bringing matching compute needs to compute availability

## New Collaborative Ecosystem

* Simplify sharing of ALL runs (not just last one) and results for later reuse
* Enable trivial reuse of existing workflows
* Develop lineage for associating experiments together
